            <h2>The Forest</h2>
            <p>
              [0,0] You are deep in the forest, far from where you began. The trees are old here, and there is no wind.
              In the light of the setting sun a pit can be seen. It is the only shelter, and passing it will leave you to
              the bitter cold and hungry beasts of the wilderness.

          <div id="1-0" class="location notHidden">
            <h2>The Gate</h2>
            <p>
              [1,0] You have entered the pit. The height of the ceiling and slick stone will not allow you back out. This is a cav
              made by nature, but lived in by something else. There is a rough floor. To the north, there is a heavy iron wrought gate with
              the light of the outdoors beyond it. To the east, a natural archway bordered by stalagmites and pillars breaks the damp cave wall.
            </p>

            <h2>Cave</h2>
            <p>
              [2,0] Deeper in the cave the floor becomes more worn. Torch smoke has stained the ceiling, and many of the caves stalagmites or stalagtites
              are broken off and hold the melted remnants of candles. In the darkness patterns and symbols can be seen on the walls, drawn in soot
              or something else. To the south lies a door of stone carved so perfectly, it seems neither man or nature could have been responsible.

            <h2>Stairs Downward</h2>
            <p>
              [0,1] This is a wooden staircase leading downward for some distance. There is a light mist almost obscuring veiw of the bottom.
              Each stair is worn with age, and a few are broken in places. There are several lanterns at intervals hanging along the rail. The exit at
              the top of the staircase lies to the east, and the exit at the bottom lies to the south.

            <h2>Greatroom</h2>
            <p>
              [1,1] This room is vast, and high. At least a dozen large heavy wooden tables surround an elevated table made of
              a single slab of stone with a carved wooden throne at the end. Huge fireplaces lie to the north and south,
              filled with long dead embers. A few tattered tapestries remain on the walls, their patterns unrecognizable.
              a small exit with a wooden door lies to the west, and a large set of intricately carved wooden doors lie to the east.
              A wooden door fitted with a lock lies to the north.

            <h2>Arched Room</h2>
            <p>
              [2,1] This is a round domed room of carved stone about the length and width of a house, and as high.
              The surfaces are all made of fist sized stones that fit together tightly. The walls are carved
              with the different phases of the moon. To the north is a door made of wood covered in cryptic
              runes the height of two humans. To the west is a wide archway and short hall lined with long dead
              torches and ending in a door.

            <h2>Cellar</h2>
            <p>
              [0,2] This is a large cellar filled wih wooden barrels and ceramic jars that sit on floor to ceiling rows of shelves.
                It smells like mildew here, and a few small stagnant puddles are seen on the stone floor. The exit lies to the south.

            <h2>The Well</h2>
            <p>
              [1,2] This room is round, about twenty steps in diameter and has a well at the center with a chain pulley and large bucket. The air is very
              damp here and moisture beads on the walls. Empty hooks for lamps are seen on two sides. The exit doorway lies to the south.

            <h2>The Crypt</h2>
            <p>
              [2,2] This is a room with a curved ceiling. It is shaped like a very wide hallway, and has the same stone structure as
              the outside. A dark stone coffin sits at the northern end on a block of similar stone, carved in complicated patterns.
              Piles of mouldering cloth, rusting metal and other materials line the walls. The air here is stale and dense.
              The exit lies to the south.
